# Bitmap-Editor
Project from course Programming Techniques

Bitmap Editor has some simple features, such as adjust brightness, saturation, contrast, crop, resize,... All of them are manually implemented, without using any image processing libraries (e.g. OpenCV).

This small software was created by a group of first year students:
- Nguyen Hoang Trung
- Ho Hoang Viet Tien
- Huynh Thi Nhi
- Pham Thi Bich Tram
- Nguyen Dang Trung Tien (leader)

The software was written using MFC framework.
